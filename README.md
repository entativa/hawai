## 🛠️ Core Technologies

### **Junita** — UI Framework
*Homage to beauty and friendship ❤️*

Declarative, reactive UI framework built on iced-rs. Create beautiful, responsive interfaces with elegant Rust code.

```rust
// Example Junita UI
use junita::{Element, button, text, column};

fn view() -> Element<Message> {
    column![
        text("Welcome to Hawai").size(32),
        button("Get Started").on_press(Message::Start)
    ]
}
```

**Features:**
- Declarative syntax inspired by SwiftUI
- Hot reload for rapid iteration
- Cross-platform rendering
- Accessible by default
- Theming system matching each OS aesthetic

### **Cirrus Engine** — ECS Powerhouse
Complex UIs, games, and interactive experiences powered by Bevy's Entity Component System.

**Use Cases:**
- High-performance dashboards with real-time data
- Interactive data visualizations
- Gaming experiences
- Custom 3D/spatial interfaces for mrOS
- Complex animations and physics

**Hybrid Approach:**
- Use **Junita** for standard UI (settings, forms, lists, navigation)
- Use **Cirrus** for complex, performance-critical interfaces
- Both share the same Hawai design language

### **T3SSA** — AI Assistant
The most intelligent assistant ever built, deeply woven into every Hawai OS.

**Powered by:**
- Linfa ML framework (Rust-native machine learning)
- On-device inference for privacy
- Context awareness across all devices
- Natural language understanding
- Computer vision capabilities
- Voice recognition and synthesis

**T3SSA knows your context:**
- What you're working on across all devices
- Your schedule, location, and habits
- Your files, photos, and conversations (all private, all local)
- Environmental context (lighting, noise, activity)

**Cross-Platform Intelligence:**
```
You: "Show me the photos from last weekend"
T3SSA: [Opens photos from Saturday/Sunday on your QiPhone]

You (on QiBook): "Continue where I left off"
T3SSA: [Opens the same photo library, right where you were]

You (on Timepiece): "How many steps today?"
T3SSA: "You've walked 8,247 steps. Great job!"
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### The Shared Foundation
Built on **Redox OS**, a Unix-like operating system written in Rust from the ground up.

**Why Redox?**
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Microkernel architecture for stability
- True isolation between components
- Modern design for modern hardware

```

### Shared Components
- **Kernel & System Services**: Common base for all OSes
- **Graphics Stack**: Unified rendering (Orbital display server)
- **Networking**: Consistent network APIs
- **Storage**: RedoxFS with cross-device sync
- **Security**: Hardware-backed encryption, sandboxing
- **IPC**: Fast inter-process communication

### Platform-Specific Optimizations
Each OS gets specialized components:
- **QissOS**: Advanced window management, desktop workflows
- **T3SS**: Touch input optimization, stylus support
- **QiOS**: Radio management, battery optimization
- **TimeOS**: Ultra-low-power modes, always-on display
- **mrOS**: Spatial computing, 3D rendering, sensor fusion

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust toolchain (stable)
- Git
- Python 3.8+

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone and setup the entire Hawai ecosystem
chmod +x hawai_setup.py
python3 hawai_setup.py

# This will shallow clone all repositories (no git history)
# and scaffold the T3SSA assistant with full project structure
```

### Building T3SSA Assistant

```bash
cd hawai/t3ssa-assistant
cargo build --release
cargo run --example basic_query
```

### Building an OS

Each OS has its own workspace with specific build instructions.

```bash
cd hawai/qissos
# Follow OS-specific README for build instructions
```

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

### 1. **Privacy First**
Your data stays on your devices. T3SSA runs locally. No cloud required for core functionality.

### 2. **Performance Matters**
Rust's zero-cost abstractions mean fast, efficient software. Every millisecond counts.

### 3. **Beautiful by Default**
Thoughtful design isn't optional—it's fundamental. Every interaction should feel effortless.

### 4. **Unified, Not Uniform**
Shared foundation, but each device gets the experience it deserves. Don't shrink desktop apps to mobile—reimagine them.

### 5. **Open Innovation**
Built on Rust, Redox OS, and open source. Stand on the shoulders of giants.
